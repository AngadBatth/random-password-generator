## Description
This is a random password generator created with JavaScript. The user is prompted with choices to include Lower case, Upper case, Numbers and Symbols in the password. The application itself generates a secure string between 8 and 128 characters for the user.
<br />

## What was learned?
While working on this I learned how to validate strings and also take input from users and assign it into variables I can use with different functions. Creating this application gave a great understanding of how nested loops and functions can be used together to create something useful. I look forward to tinkering with the code and adding new features to it as well as updating the CSS.
